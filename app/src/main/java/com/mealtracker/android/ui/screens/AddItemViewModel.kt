 *     -> BARCODE_LOOKUP -> BARCODE_RESULT
 *         -> matched existing item: done
 *         -> no match: one confirmation tap -> CAPTURE_PRODUCT_PHOTO
 *   (or, if the timeout fires with nothing detected: a prompt offers
 *    MANUAL_BARCODE_ENTRY, which feeds into the same lookup)
 *
 *   CAPTURE_PRODUCT_PHOTO (live, in-app camera OR gallery pick; always
 *   cropped client-side before upload, same as the label step)
 *     -> PROCESSING_PRODUCT_PHOTO -> CAPTURE_LABEL (name/brand/image
 *        carried into state, pre-filled but still editable in the
 *        eventual form - see scanProductPhoto())
 *
 *   CAPTURE_LABEL (live, in-app camera OR gallery pick)
 *     -> PROCESSING_LABEL -> ITEM_FORM (pre-filled, barcode/name/brand/
 *        image carried over)
 *         -> SAVING -> SAVED
