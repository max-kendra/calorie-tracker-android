/**
 * First-run required setup - reached instead of the normal Home/Journal
 * tabs when the profile is incomplete or no calorie goal exists yet (see
 * OnboardingGateViewModel, which decides this at app launch). Reuses the
 * exact same four screens normally reached individually via Settings -
 * no separate onboarding-specific UI was built, just a fixed order +
 * auto-advance wiring (onSaved) + a page-indicator strip pinned under
 * them.
 *
 * Order: profile basics -> weight goal -> calorie goal (weight/activity/
 * TDEE calc/save) -> macro distribution -> Health Connect. This matches
 * the dependency order of the data itself - e.g. the calorie-goal
 * calculation needs height+age from step 1, and the macro screen needs
 * an active goal to exist, which step 3 is what creates. Health Connect
 * comes last since it depends on nothing else and nothing else depends
 * on it.
 *
 * Deliberately no skip option and no way to back out past step 0 for
 * steps 0-3 - see design discussion: every new item / the rest of the
 * app assumes a complete profile + active goal exist, so those are
 * required, not optional, the first time through. Step 4 (Health
 * Connect) is the one exception - see HealthConnectOnboardingStep's
 * own doc comment for why that one IS skippable.
